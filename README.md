#Python-Chatting-Application

This is a chat application that I made with python the thing is that it only works on your local computer... I don't know how to run this on windows but for mac users type the following.

First off, Save the chat_server.py and chat_client into a folder and name the folder Chat. Save the folder to Desktop and type this in Terminal. (each $ is a different command, DO NOT WRITE THE DOLLAR SIGN...)

$ cd Desktop

$ cd Chat

$ python chat_server.py

Now you have ran the server, after that open another Terminal window (now you have 2 Terminals open). Type the following.

$ cd Desktop

$ cd Chat

$ python chat_client.py localhost 9009

Now open yet another Terminal window (now you have 3 Terminal open). Type the following.

$ cd Desktop

$ cd Chat

$ python chat_client.py localhost 9009

You are now ready DO NOT CLOSE THE TERMINAL WINDOW IN WHICH YOU RAN THE SEVER IN. In the Terminal window in which you ran the client type something and you will see it on the other window in which you ran the second chat_client.py.

Enjoy and please if you know how to make this work on more than one computer instead of only on your computer please tell me I will be more than glad to know. And also if you have any questions DO NOT HESITATE TO ASK...

Have fun!
